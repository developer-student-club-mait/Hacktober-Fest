"Our memories of yesterday will last a lifetime,
 We will take the best, forget the rest,
 And someday we will find that these are the best of times.."

 Good Morning respected dignitaries, excellencies, respected teachers and my dear friends. 
 I feel honoured and privileged to welcome you all on this special occasion. 

 The time has come when we have to go confidently in the direction of our dreams and live 
 the life that we've imagined!

 I know "Feelings are always pure and most glowing at the time of farewell! "
 But as we have started here together, we have to leave the same way to fulfill all our dreams..

"The direction of wind has been changed, 
 and it's our time now to sail our ship in the right direction to get to the destination"

"Journey of life is never planned, it is meant to be travelled and enjoyed,
 and always remember that it is our journey that teaches us a lot about our destination" 

 From tomorrow, we will definitely miss our classrooms, canteen, specially the 
 school uniform that we wear for 12 years, the annual functions at the end of the year and many more
 but will cherish them forever in our hearts.  
 
 "Just like every end has a new beginning,
 Today, we are closing the door to the past, opening it to the future,
 So take a deep breath,
 Step on through,
 Because we are going to start a new chapter in our life.."










 So let's take this moment and make it together worth remembering...
